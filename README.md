## About

Icons proposed by Bootstrap Icons are very nice.  
However, there are no simple tools to customise them and download them in classic image formats.  
This project solves this lack.

## Features

- **Simple** and **lightweight**
- **All Bootstrap Icons**
- **Customisation** of the icon's **colour**
- **Customisation** of the icon's **size**
- **Export** in **png** or **svg** format

## Build

First check that you have **Node.js**, **npm** and **Python** installed on your machine.  
Then, run:  
```bash
./build.sh
```
